<h1>The Basics of Our Order</h1>
The 3 steps in the OA are  Ordeal, Brotherhood, and Vigil member. But don't consider this as ranks because each member is entitled to every right, this is just strengthening your membership. The OA is all about service, so that is what we do. To be in the OA means you have been chossen by your fellow scouts; because they think that you as a person eximplify the scout oath and law. We also as an order develop and maintain camping traditions

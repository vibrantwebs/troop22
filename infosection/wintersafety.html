<h1>Winter Safety</h1>
Safety is an important part of camping, but it is often overlooked because it is viewed as boring or even
unnecessary. However, it is important. The first and most important part of safety is stated in the scout
motto, which states "<i>be prepared.</i>" Being prepared means more than just bringing all of the proper safety
equipment. It involves learning first aid, putting the buddy system into practice, and using good judgement
in situations when it is required.<br>
<h3>First Aid</h3>
At least once or twice a year, Troop 22 organizes a first aid refresher presentation, usually given by the 
skills instructor. Everyone needs to learn the basics of first aid, not just a single person or a select few.
Understanding why certain techniques are applied, such as applying pressure to lacerations (big cuts), can help
the scout act on his own before more professional help arrives. For example, if a scout fell onto a sharp rock
and cut himself, he would need to know what to do <u>before</u> help arrived. In a situation like that, how the
scout applies first aid (when it is first required) can be more critical to his well-being than after help arrives.<br>
The most basic first aid situations that occur during the winter often involve the cold temperature. Hypothermia,
frost bite, and more are occurences that have happened many times during winter campouts. Discussing every
piece of information about every situation that can possibly arrise would be enough to make a book. However, learning
and understanding the rules of respecting the winter and wild are easy enough to remember:<br><br>
<b>(1) Respect the wild and winter:</b> Avoid making careless mistakes. Always recognize that nature and weather
can be very dangerous in their extremes. The buddy system is not recommended, it is required. Wearing a whistle
around your neck will allow you to alert help, in areas where cell phones will fail.<br><br>
<b>(2) Bring a buddy:</b> Always remember to bring a buddy. If one scout becomes injured, the other scout is
there to help. It also makes one less likely to get lost, or make a mistake.<br><br>
<b>(3) Be prepared for the worst:</b> If you don't prepare for situations, you are setting yourself up
for danger. Being prepared is more than just bringing the proper equipment, it also invloves how to act
in certain situations. However, it is vitally important that every troop has a first aid kit that is accessible
and in a location that everyone knows about.<br>
As stated before, a good guide to first aid invloving cold weather would be a large amount of information to
fit on a single page. For an excellent, yet simple, guide to cold weather first aid, please click

<h3>The Buddy System</h3>
The buddy system is a practice that can make hiking much safer. In fact, having a buddy with you at 
all times can help you avoid dangerous situations all together. The buddy system is very simple: always
have someone else with you at all times.<br>
If something happens to one person, it is the responsibility of his "buddy" to help him out. If one scout
gets hurt, the other scout should first decide how bad his condition is. Some situations require medical
help. Sometimes, the injured scout will be unconscious or unable to walk. It is important that the scouts
remain together if they are unsure of their surroundings. Otherwise, two dangerous situations can occur:<br>
- The scout searching for help becomes lost<br>
- The injured scout cannot be located<br>
The best way to solve this problem, if medical help is immediately required, is to leave an easy trail to follow.
Rope usually works best. However, avoiding this situation all together is a much better option.<br>
<h3>Tips and Hints</h3>
Usually, the worst aspect of winter camping is the cold weather. The best way to stay warm and healthy is to come
well-prepared for cold weather. Also, eating plenty of food and drinking plenty of water is vital. Many times, you
will not feel thirsty even if you are dehydrated. Always have water available in a waterbottle or canteen. To avoid
the water from freezing overnight, place it near your pillow (NOT by the fire.) Also, to keep the cap from freezing,
place the water bottle upside down, so the ice will freeze to the bottom of the container overnight, and not the top.<br>
Another useful item is a flashlight. It is very easy to slip on ice, especially at night. Also, the snow usually
covers fallen limbs and logs, making them much harder to see without light. At night, keep your flashlight next to your
boots, so you always know where both items are in case you need to go to the bathroom.<br>
Finally, staying warm at night is very important, as the weather drops dangerously at night. Again, being prepared
is important. Make sure you have a thick sleeping bag, or two thin sleeping bags, to sleep in. In addition, put a light
sheet or cloth over your sleeping bags. This prevents frost from collecting on the sleeping bag. Shake the cloth in the
morning, so the frost doesn't melt into the fabric during the day. Also, the best way to retain heat is to wear a 
stocking cap. A lot of heat escapes from your head. Pull the stocking cap over your ears, which will keep them warm.
Wear socks to keep your feet warm, and wear a tee-shirt to keep your body warm. DO NOT wear your coat to bed, for two
reasons:<br>
<ul>
<li>The coat is covered in moisture from snow and sweat, which can freeze overnight</li>
<li>Thick coats can cause you to sweat, which will freeze as soon as your body cools down</li>
</ul>
Finally, frozen boots are no fun to deal with. During the day, snow gets all over the inside and outside of your boots.
During the night, the moisture freezes the boot, which makes getting it back on very difficult. This can make your feet
cold, and even give you blisters. The best way to avoid this is to put the boots inside the shelter.

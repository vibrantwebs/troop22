<h1>Building a Winter Shelter</h1>
The main purpose of a lean-to shelter is to keep the elements out, such as snow, wind, rain, and cold.
To accomplish this, the shelter must be built correctly. Shelters are constructed each year at the Polar
Bear Camporee for the scouts to sleep and store their gear in. This short guide gives a basic description
of how they are built. It also lists a few rules that should be followed.
<h3>How to Build a Lean To</h3>
A lean to is the most common type of shelter, as it is effective and easy to build. It is designed mostly
for sleeping, and its triangular shape keeps the worst effects of the wind away from those inside. Its shape
also causes rain water to run off the shelter, away from the entrance.<br>
Building the shelter is easy to do with proper materials, and enough helpers. Depending on the size, it
can take anywhere from 3 to 6 hours to build a shelter for a troop. Here is a list of what is needed to
build a shelter:
<ul>
<li>pocket knife</li>
<li>saw</li>
<li>twine or rope</li>
<li>wooden poles</li>
<li>large tarp (or several small ones)</li>
<li>straw</li>
<li>able workers</li>
</ul>
The most difficult part of building the shelter is knowing your knots and lashings. Once you know how to
tie a clove hitch, and you know how to do a square lashing, you can begin building. To start off, find two
sturdy trees. Find the largest, thickest pole and lash it between the trees about 5 feet off the ground. 
If you have rope, it is recommended that you use it on these two lashings, as the entire weight of the shelter
is focused on this pole.<br>
After this is in place, lay several poles atop the thick pole, perpendicular to it in direction. These poles should
lean against the thick pole without rolling off. Tie them off if you wish, but they should balance on their own.<br><img src="http://www.troop22quincy.8m.com/infosection/leanto.jpg" align=right>
Now you have the basic framework, but its not quite time to put the tarp on yet. Now, place several poles parallel
to the thick pole about 2 or 3 feet apart, all the way from the top to the bottom. These poles must be lashed, or else
they will roll down the frame.<br>
Now, place the tarps over the framework. Make sure that every inch of the top is closed, or rainwater will leak in. Do not tie off the
tarp on the front of the shelter, as it is the entrance flap used to get in and out. (It allows you to get in and out, but not the wind
or the cold.)<br>
To complete the shelter, you must finish the inside. The ground is often even colder than the air, so
it must be insulated to keep the cold ground as far away from the sleeping bag as possible. To do this,
a tarp should cover every inch of the shelter on the inside. After that, straw, or some other form of
insulation, should be scattered on top. Finally, a second tarp is placed over the straw to keep the straw
from getting all over the place.
<h3>How to Build a Lean To</h3>
Certain rules must be followed to make sure the shelter remains in decent condition. The most basic
rule is recognize the two purposes of the shelter: sleeping and storing gear. As long as these rules are followed,
nothing will be damaged, and the shelter will not collapse.<br><br>
Here is a short list of the basic rules to follow:<br>
(1) Do not rough house in the shelter<br>
(2) Do not light fires in the shelter<br>
(3) Avoid walking on other people's gear<br>
(4) Keep everything neat and organized<br>
(5) Don't hang any heavy gear on the ceiling beams<br>

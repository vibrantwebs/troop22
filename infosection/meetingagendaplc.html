<h1>PLC Aenda</h1>
<b>Meeting Called to Order</b><br>
The Senior Patrol Leader begins the meeting by calling it to order, usually around 6:00 PM. The prayer is said by the
Chaplains Aid, and the meeting begins.
<br>
<br>
<b>Roll Call</b><br>
The Scribe takes note of everyone that is present, and records it.
<br>
<br>
<b>Read Previous Meeting Log</b><br>
The notes from the previous meeting (recorded by the scribe) are read and reviewed.
<br>
<br>
<b>Patrol Leaders' Reports</b><br>
Every patrol leader present gives a short report on how his patrol is doing, mostly in terms of advancement.
<br>
<br>
<b>Old Business</b><br>
Previous meetings and events are discussed. We discuss how they went, and how we can improve them in the future.
<br>
<br>
<b>New Business</b><br>
Upcoming meetings and events are discussed. This includes campouts, meeting agendas, events, and anything else that needs
to be planned for or simply brought up.
<br>
<br>
<b>Planning Ahead</b><br>
This is a short overview of when the next PLC meeting is. We also note any meetings that will be cancelled or changed. This
discussion is often very brief, as it is only an overview.
<br>
<br>
<b>Scoutmaster's Minute</b><br>
The scoutmaster is given the full attention of the PLC. This is an opportunity for the scoutmaster to offer any input, on any
topic that is important. This can include comments on how to improve our meetings, reminders, or anything else. Because much of the 
talking is done by the scouts during the PLC, it is important to devote a portion of the meeting to allow the adult leaders offer
their input.
<br>
<br>
<b>Meeting Planning</b>
A theme is assigned to each month, such as hiking, public service, and sports. The troop meetings of each month are modelled around these
themes, and incorporated into the meeting agenda. This portion of the meeting is used to discuss how to apply the monthly theme to the meeting,
through activities, skills instruction, and patrol activities.
<br>
<br>
<b>Closing</b>
The Senior Patrol Leader makes a motion to adjourn, which is seconded by another member of the council. The scribe writes down what time the
meeting is adjourned.

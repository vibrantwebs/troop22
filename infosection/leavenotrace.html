<h1>Leave No Trace</h1>
Leave no Trace is a method that is put to practice by scouts. Leave no trace is used to help preserve the wilderness
so others can enjoy it. Many camping areas where Troop 22 stays are areas that have been camped in many times
before, and will continue to be camped in after we leave. Because of this constant use of the area, it is
important to keep it as preserved as possible. For example, if one group leaves a bunch of trash lying around, the
area doesn't look as natural as it did before they arrived. In addition, if another group comes along and 
drops even more trash, the area looks twice as bad for the third group. This situation is a very common one.
The area must look exactly as you found it when you leave. If another group drops trash, ashes, or other remains,
it is your duty to clean it up so the next group can enjoy it. Here are some good ways to use leave no trace
effectively.
<ul>
<li>make only 1 fire</li>
<li>scatter/bury ashes from fire area</li>
<li>police the area before leaving</li>
<li>carry trash out of camp</li>
<li>leave what you find (unless it is unnatural, like trash</li>
</ul>
While these points are important for areas that are meant to be preserved, different rules apply to public areas,
such as campgrounds. Campgrounds usually have a fire ring and a latrine. Make all your fires in the fire ring, as
this will keep the ground clean. Also, the latrine is a good place to dump wastes, such as dishwater and food
scraps. The latrine is full of bacteria, and the waste will quickly decompose. Leave no trace is an very important
practice to preserve the wilderness. If you want to learn more, click <a href="http://www.scouting.org/boyscouts/resources/21-105/">here</a>.
